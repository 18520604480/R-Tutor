c++ 的指针调用

$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$
```
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    
    int fish = 5;
    int *fishP ;  // a different way to assign the type of data.
                    // we need to assign the address to fishP;
                    //*fishp means a value;
    fishP = &fish;

    cout << fishP<<endl;

    cout << &fish <<endl;
    cout << *fishP <<endl;
    
    cout << **&fishP <<endl;
    cout << *&*fishP<< endl;
    
    // cout << *&&fishP<<endl;//wrong; 
    // cout << &**fishP<<endl;//wrong;
}
```
// you can find fishP is a pointer
// *fishP means define fishP's type is a pointer;
// and then we assign fish's address into fishP;
// so now, fishP is an address instead of an value.
